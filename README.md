# GitHub Releases To Discord Action

A GitHub Action that sends a stylized Discord webhook containing the description of a GitHub Release to a specified Discord channel. It formats the description to improve readability and includes various configuration options to customize the message.

## Features

- **Text Cleanup:**
  - **Carriage Return Removal:** Automatically removes carriage return characters for clean formatting.
  - **HTML Comment Stripping:** Eliminates HTML comments to remove unnecessary information.
  - **Whitespace Optimization:** Reduces redundant newlines and excess spaces while preserving proper paragraph spacing.
- **Mention Conversion:** Converts GitHub mentions (e.g., `@username`) into clickable GitHub profile links for easy navigation.
- **Markdown Link Conversion:**
- **Link Removal (Optional):** Remove PR and commit links from the changelog.
  - **PR Links:** Converts pull request URLs into Markdown links (e.g., `[PR #1](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/1)`).
  - **Issue Links:** Converts issue URLs into Markdown links (e.g., `[Issue #1](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/1)`).
  - **Changelog Links:** Converts changelog comparison URLs into concise Markdown links (e.g., `[v1.0.0...v1.1.0](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)`).
- **Heading Reduction (Optional):** If enabled, it reduces heading sizes for a cleaner, more compact display:
  - H3 headings are converted to bold and underlined.
  - H2 headings are converted to bold.
- **Description Length Management:** Ensures the release description fits within Discord's embed message limits (default 4096 characters), trimming excess text by cutting at newlines when possible or adding a continuation link.
- **Custom Embed Appearance:**
  - Set a custom color for the Discord embed message.
  - Optionally include a custom footer with a title, icon, and a timestamp to make the notification more informative.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages for any invalid or missing inputs, ensuring that the webhook action does not fail silently.
- **Webhook Delivery:** Sends the formatted message to the specified Discord channel via webhook, ensuring your release notifications are promptly delivered with the correct details.

## Setup Instructions

1. Open your **Server Settings** and head into the **Integrations** tab:
2. Click the "**Create Webhook**" button to create a new webhook!
   ![create webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/1500000463501/Screen_Shot_2020-12-15_at_4.41.53_PM.png)
   ![created webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360101553853/Screen_Shot_2020-12-15_at_4.51.38_PM.png)
3. Copy the webhook url
4. Create a new GitHub repository secret called WEBHOOK_URL and paste the webhook url into it.

5. Save the secret.
6. Add the secret to your action configuration.

And you're done! Whenever you create a new release, the workflow should run and, if properly setup, post to your specified Discord channel.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for how GitHub Releases To Discord Action could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Install node and run `npm install`.
3. Install [Github Action tester `act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)
4. Create a sample test Release file to simulate a webhook payload object such as `tests/sample-test-release.json` with the following structure:
  
```json
{
  "action": "published",
  "release": {
      ...
  },
  "repository": {
      ...
  },
  "sender": {
      ...
  }
}
```

This file will be used to test the action locally and simulate a real release event webhook payload. Refer to the [GitHub Webhook documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads?actionType=published#release) and the [Github API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-release) for more information on the webhook payload structure.

6. Fill the test json file with the necessary fields to simulate a release event.
5. Create a test file called `.env` in the main root of the project with the following environmental variables:

```bash
  INPUT_WEBHOOK_URL=
  INPUT_COLOR=
  INPUT_USERNAME=
  INPUT_AVATAR_URL=
  INPUT_CONTENT=
  INPUT_FOOTER_TITLE=
  INPUT_FOOTER_ICON_URL=
  INPUT_FOOTER_TIMESTAMP=
  INPUT_MAX_DESCRIPTION=
  INPUT_REDUCE_HEADINGS=
```

8. Fill the `.env` file with your chosen environmental variables values.
9. Create a Discord webhook in your server, making sure to add the webhook url to the `.env` file under `INPUT_WEBHOOK_URL=`.
10. Run the action locally with `act release -e <your.json>` (e.g., `act release -e tests/sample-test-release.json`) and check the output in your Discord server.
11. Confirm that the action works as expected.
12. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m '<commit_message>'`. Please follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
13. Create the pull request.
